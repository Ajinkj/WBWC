# WBWC
Water Bodies Waste collector.
# Abstract: 
One of the most severe threats to nature that the ever growing world is facing today is plastic contamination inÂ river, pond, lake or any surface water. New initiatives to extract plastics from the ocean for economic use are emerging at different levels. All of these activities are in need of information on where to locate plastics in amounts that would make this extraction economically viable.

Here we are presenting a cost-effective semi-automated robot with advanced control features that can assist the human in removing the floating water waste safely and quickly making work easier and more sustainable. 

Our robot could detect and collect plastic waste effectively. In case of oceans, lakes, etc, the location were the plastic is collected is recorded, along  with that the stream speed there is also recorded. These data can be used to predict from were this plastic are coming and could take  preventive measures. These data can also be used to locate plastics in amounts that would make this extraction economically viable.

We are also implementing a grass cutter to cut water plants which cause harm to aquatic life , the  waste is collected and can be used as fertilizer after processing. The robot could automatically move around, the camera module will detect the waste in the water, the robot will position it self and start the conveyor to collect the waste. Obstacle avoidance sensors are embedded to avoid any obstacle on the way. The robot is IOT enabled and can be controlled from anywhere in the world.
